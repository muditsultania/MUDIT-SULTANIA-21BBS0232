# Welcome to the Ultimate Chess-Like Game!
## Hey there!

You’ve found the coolest chess-like game I put together during exam season. Between cramming and coding, I managed to create something pretty fun. Here’s the lowdown on how it came together and how to use it.

## How It All Happened
In the middle of exams, I needed a break from textbooks, so I decided to dive into some more work. Armed with coffee and a deadline, I crafted this sad game to complete my assignment ( LOOKING AT YOU HITWICKET!) 

## How to Use It
Start the Game: Just open index.html in your browser. You’ll see a game board ready for action.

## Playing the Game:

### Objective: Outmaneuver your opponent and capture their pieces. It’s chess with a fun twist!
### Moves: Click on a piece to select it, then click on a valid move spot. The game will highlight where you can move, so you’ll always know your options.
### Winning: Capture all of your opponent’s pieces to win the game.
### Reset the Game: When the game ends, you can hit the "Restart Game" button that pops up to start fresh.

## What’s Going On Behind the Scenes
### Frontend: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It might not win any design awards, but it works!
### Backend: Uses Flask and Socket.IO to handle game logic and keep everything running smoothly.
## About the UI
Full disclosure: the design could definitely be better. With exams breathing down my neck, I focused more on getting the game to work than on perfecting the look. If you’re into UI design, feel free to make it look amazing!


## How to Play
### Setup: Open the game in your browser.
### Select a Piece: Click on a piece you want to move.
### Highlight Moves: The game will show you where you can move. Click on a highlighted cell to make your move.
### Make a Move: Move your piece to a valid cell. Capture your opponent’s pieces to win.
### Restart: Hit "Restart Game" if you want a fresh start.

# Note: Server Not Hosted
Right now, the backend server (server.py) isn’t hosted online, so this game is running in a local environment only. To play it, you’d need to:

Run the Server Locally: If you want to test or play the game, you’ll need to run server.py on your local machine. Make sure you have Flask and Socket.IO installed.
Start the Game: Open index.html in a browser, ensuring that the server is running at the specified address (e.g., http://localhost:5000).
